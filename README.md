# portu-bot
A chain bot made from scratch by me. It is made to be a discord chat bot but can be dumb (it doesnt use machine learning)
The bot works by taking your messages and randomly saying them + some specific sentences it can respond to (questions, etc)

# Requirements
- Nodejs v18.16.1 (the current newest version)
- dotenv
- discordjs

# Instructions
1. Download the source code and put it inside a folder.
2. Extract the rar inside the folder
3. Open the index.js file if you wanna change anything (its gonna be commented if you want help)
4. Open the .env and change TOKEN= to your bot token
5. Make a bat file.
6. Add this into it ```:a
node .\index.js
goto a```
7. Run the bat file after you've changed the index.js to start the bot.
8. (optional) Open the cache.txt and change the first word if you want.

# Usage
